# Bootstrap-It
Creates a GUI window with Python utilizing ttkbootstrap. I use it to test code that interacts with the Windows file system.

Code is not fully fleshed out
I still need to add a:
1)  Messagebox
2)  QueryDialog

I will add more functionality with ttkbootstrap as this file is meant for me to have a reference for the module
and it has the added benefit of possibly helping others

Please feel free to add constructive input as this is my first Github project.

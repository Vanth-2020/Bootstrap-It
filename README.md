# Bootstrap-It
Creates a GUI window with Python utilizing ttkbootstrap. I use it to test code that interacts with the Windows file system.
You make the changes required to make the buttons do some task or add other functionality.

Code is not fully fleshed out as I need to add a:
1)  Messagebox and a
2)  QueryDialog

I will add more functionality with ttkbootstrap as this file is meant for me to have a reference for the module
and it has the added benefit of possibly helping others

Please feel free to add constructive input as this is my first Github project.
